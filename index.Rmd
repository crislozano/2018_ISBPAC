For example, if you play frisbee, you need to predict the position of the frisbee in order to be able to catch it. When you want to prepare a sandwich, you need to anticipate the ingredients you will need, or when you are actually making it, studies show that your eyes start looking at the next step you are going to do, before you actually do it.

---

# Linguistic prediction

--
## **Pre-activation** of stored linguistic information

--

## Important for: **sentence comprehension**

--

## Listeners are not passive, they **generate expectations**

???

Language is no exception to these anticipatory mechanisms. During this presentation, prediction or anticipation are synonyms, meaning: pre-activation of stored linguistic information before it is actually said.

class: inverse

# Goal

- ### Investigate whether experience with complex processing (interpreting) can train anticipatory processing
--


- ### Are there differences in the use of lexical stress for morphology anticipation between interpreters, non-interpreters and monolinguals?

--

- ### Does working memory modulate anticipation?

# Morphosyntactic <br/> anticipation <br/> 

???

I will start by reviewing the literature on morphological and semantic anticipation, both during native and second language processing.

---

# L1 Morphosyntactic Anticipation

- Natives anticipate rapidly and effortlessly (Kamide, 2008), although not under all circumstances (Nieuwland et al., 2018)

- Both adults and children use gender and case marking to make morphosyntactic predictions (Spanish, Dutch, German, French) (Dussias et al., 2013) (Lew-Williams & Fernald, 2007)
    - Eg. "Encuentra la galleta" (Find the-FEM cookie)
    
- Case-marking is also used predictively by natives (Mitsugi & MacWhinney, 2016)

- These studies show that morphosyntax is important for expectation generation  of upcoming linguistic information.

---

# L2 Morphosyntactic Anticipation


- ## Intermediate late learners:

    - reduced or no integration of L2 discourse cues (Grüter et al., 2017), syntactic cues (Grüter & Rohde, 2013), and morphological cues (Foucart et al., 2016; Grüter et al., 2010; Hopp, 2015; Lew-Williams & Fernald, 2007) 
    
    - unless the two languages are typologically similar (Liburd, 2014; Dussias et al., 2013; Foucart et al., 2014).
    
- ## Advanced late learners: 

    - can use morphological cues to predict morphosyntax (Marull, 2017) and syntax (Dussias et al., 2013; Kaan et al., 2010; Kaan, 2014)
    
    - cannot use morphological cues to predict morphosyntax (Hopp, 2015; Martin et al., 2013), or prosodic cues to predict morphology (Rehrig, 2017). 




???

Multiple studies have come to the conclusion that grammatical gender is a strong cue for anticipation. This has been tested in multiple languages like: spanish, dutch, german or french. 

Is this eye-tracking studies, the participants listen to sentences like "Encuentra la galleta" while the see typically 4 objects on the screen. When only one of the objects is feminine (in this case), the are able to direct their eyes to the cookie right after the determiner "la" is pronounced, and before the noun is said.

Another syntactic cue that has been studied is case-marking, in languages such as Japanese or German.

What happens with second language?

# Interpreters

???

Now I will continue explaining why have chosen this particular bilingual population (besides because of personal reasons). This is me doing an interpreting internship at the Human Rights Council at the UN in Geneva. 

---

# Interpreters & Processing

- Very complex task, Efforts Model (Gile, 2009)
    - Listening, analysis, production, and memory

- Better at: semantic and lexical access, reading speed and comprehension, resistance to articulatory suppression, cognitive flexibility, working memory, phonological short-term memory (Bajo et al, 2000).

- Better than natives at error detection in their L2 (Yudes et al. 2013)

- They adapt the parsing preference for ambiguous sentences depending on the task (reading or interpreting) (Togato et al. 2015)


???

Togato: When reading ambiguous sentences that could be interpreted with both low attachment (preferred by English natives) and high attachment (preferred by Spanish natives), they adapt to the preference according to the task they are doing.

# Interpreters & Anticipation

## Anticipation...

.pull-left[
- is taught in simultaneous interpreting courses (Li, 2015)

- releases cognitive load (Seeber et al, 2011)

- has been studied in language pairs with asymmetrical syntactic structures (SVO/SOV) (Van Besien, 1999)

- happens at high rates and is successful most of o the time (Liontou, 2012)

- is possible thanks to contextual knowledge (both general and from the specific text), and syntactic knowledge (Moser-Mercer, 1978)

]
--

.pull-right[



- But we still don't know
  - Other cues?
  - Other referents?
  - Interpreting practice enhances anticipation?
]

???

Interpreters are also interesting for this topic because they use anticipation while performing simultaneous interpreting.

# Working memory

???

I will now review the another factor that I'm going to explore, which the possibility of WM modulating anticipation

WM is the executive function component dedicated to storing and processing information at the same time

---
# Working memory


.pull-left[

## Anticipation

- WM mediates ability to anticipate in natives (Huettig & Janse, 2016)
  - 'Kijk naar de afgebeelde piano' 
  
- Although not always (Otten & Van Berkum, 2009)
  - 'She picked up the-COM delicate yet striking necklace that had been selected by her stylist.'
  - More time was allowed to predict

- What happens with L2 learners?

- What happens with WM and prosodic cues?

]

--

.pull-right[

## Interpreters

- Some find that interpreters have better WM than non-interpreter bilinguals (review Dong & Cai, 2015)

- Others don't 
  - Different tasks, confusion between WM and phonological short-term memory, differences in population (students, amount of experience) and age

- Our study will look at:
  - WM differences between interpreters and non-interpreters
  - WM as a mediating factor for anticipation
]

class: inverse, center, middle

# Prosodic cues
 
???

In this coming section, I will review the literature related to the prosodic cue I research: Lexical Stress

---

# Lexical Stress

- Relative prominece of a syllable in relation to the rest of syllable in a word.
- Correlates: Tone (F0), duration (ms), and intesity (dB)
- Contrastive in English and Spanish, but used differently

--

.pull-left[

### English
- Stress-timed (interval between two stressed syllables is the same)
  - Unstressed vowels: reduction (usually to [ə]) 
- English natives use suprasegmental information for lexical access, but segmental information has a stronger role in lexical activation (Cooper et al., 2002).
- Mandarin L2ers of English use only suprasegmental cues and Korean L2ers use both segmental and suprasegmental cues (Connell et al., 2018) 
]

--

.pull-right[

### Spanish
- Syllable-timed (duration of every syllable is the same)
  - Stressed vowels: slightly longer
  - Spanish natives rely on F0, intensity and duration to identify stress
- English L2 learners of Spanish have problems with stress production and perception (Face, 2006; Lord, 2007). 
- Both suprasegmental and segmental information contribute equally to the activation of word forms (Soto-Faraco et al., 2001)

]

???

Constrative means that it changes meaning: PApa vs. paPÁ, CONtent vs. conTENT





---

# Prosodic Cues to Predict Morphology

.pull-left[

## L1

- Contrastive intonation guides the initial syntactic analysis (for Japanese Nakamura et al., 2012)

- English vowel duration preactivates upcoming morphology (active/pasive verbs) (Stromswold et al., 2002)

- Swedish word-tones preactive upcoming morhphology (present/past, singular/plural) (Roll, Söderström & Horne, 2013)
]

--

.pull-right[

## L2

- Advanced L2ers of English cannot use vowel duration for prediction (Rehrig, 2017)

- Advanced L2ers of Swedish can use word tones for prediction (Schremm et al., 2016)

- Beginning L2ers of Swedish cannot use word tones (Gosselke Berthelse et al, 2018)

- It is possible to explicitly train morphological prediction based on word-tones (at beginner level) (Schremm et al., 2017)

# The study


---

# Research questions

### 1. Do Spanish monolinguals, non-interpreter bilinguals and interpreters use lexical stress to anticipate morphology? If yes, does syllabic structure (CV, CVC) influence their anticipatory abilities? 

### 2. Does interpreting experience train anticipatory processing?

### 3. Is working memory a mediating factor in the anticipation of morphological information based on lexical stress?

# Eye-tracking: sample trial

???
After calibration, the participant saw a fixation cross for 250ms, followed by 1000ms of the two possible words (as it is standard in visual world paradigm experiments), and then they listened to a sentence containing one of the two words.

---
# Eye-tracking task: lexical stress to anticipate morphology

- 16 pairs of sentences
  - 8 paroxytone (present verbs)
  - 8 oxytone (past verbs)
  - 7 CVC and 9 CV (first syllable of the verb)

- 5 words long

- Semantically viable (for both conditions)

<ru-blockquote>La mujer llena la jarra. (The woman fills the jar) <br/>
La mujer llenó la jarra. (The woman filled the jar) </ru-blockquote>

---
# Working memory

### Letter-number sequencing

- Participant listens to numbers and letters

- Remembers them 

- Organizes them: first numbers (numerical order), then letters (alphabetical order)

# Discussion

---


# 1. Can they predict?

- Monolinguals & interpreters fixate on targets earlier than non-interpreters = INTERPRETER ADVANTAGE.

- Non-interpreters can predict if CVC, but can’t if CV.

    - CV: Interpreters initially fixate less, but at a faster rate than natives (they get to the same point by target offset)
    - CVC: interpreters = monolinguals

# 2. Does WM mediate anticipation?

- Our data doesn't support WM as a mediating factor of anticipation

---

# 3. Does complex processing train anticipation?

- YES, interpreters perform closer to monolinguals.

- Non-interpreters (LA): Only anticipate when more time and phonological information are present

- All fixate more on targets in CVC (firma-firmó) than CV (lava-lavó)

- Monolinguals and interpreters fixate on targets more than non-interpreters = INTERPRETER ADVANTAGE



---

# Conclusions

1. Our findings support models advocating that it is possible to train anticipatory processing (Schremm, et al., 2017), not only explicetly, but also through complex processing.

2. Qualitatively (can they do it?): it is possible to learn L2 anticipatory patterns (non-interpreters) post-puberty, and “practice makes you better” (interpreters).

3. Quantitatively (how early they predict?): the monolinguals are the winners.

I wanted to end with a quote that I believe captures why anticipation is important, although probably not necessary for comprehension.
